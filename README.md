# 🚦 Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94

Welcome to the I-94 Traffic Detective Project! 🕵️‍♂️

Ever wondered what makes traffic on I-94 go from smooth sailing to bumper-to-bumper? In this project, we dive into real traffic data to uncover the secrets behind those heavy traffic jams. Spoiler: it's not just the weather!

## 📊 What We Did
- **Explored** a rich dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Visualized** traffic patterns by month, day, and hour
- **Compared** business days vs. weekends (hint: weekends win!)
- **Investigated** the impact of weather (rain, snow, and more!)

## 🏆 Key Findings
- **Time rules the road!** The heaviest traffic happens on weekday mornings and late afternoons, especially in spring and fall.
- **Weather?** Meh. Most weather has little effect, but watch out for light rain and snow—they can slow things down.
- **Weekends = Easy cruising.**
